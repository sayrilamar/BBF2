# Executive BRS Summary — FlightValue (Metasearch Flight Search)

## 1) Purpose
FlightValue helps travelers quickly find the best **“bang for their buck”** flights by ranking results with a **clear, disclosed formula** that combines **total price** and **total duration**. Unlike “Best” labels in other apps, FlightValue explains exactly why a flight is ranked as the best value.

## 2) Target Users
- Global travelers who value **time and money** and want a transparent tradeoff.
- No accounts or login required.

## 3) Platforms (v1)
- iOS + Android

## 4) v1 Scope (In)
### 4.1 Search
- One-way and round-trip searches
- Inputs: origin, destination, dates (and basic passenger/cabin defaults)

### 4.2 Compare + Rank (Core Differentiator)
- Default ranking uses a **Value Score**:
  - **ValueScore = TotalPrice + (DurationHours × TimeValuePerHour)**
  - DurationHours = DurationMinutes / 60
  - TimeValuePerHour defaults to 30 (currency units/hour) and is **user-adjustable**
- Each result shows:
  - Total price (primary), base fare, taxes/fees
  - Total duration (hh:mm) and stops
  - ValueScore + a readable breakdown (e.g., “$412 + (7.5h × $30/h) = $637”)
- Badges:
  - Best Value (top by ValueScore)
  - Optional: Cheapest, Fastest

### 4.3 Filters & Sorting (Minimum viable)
- Filters: stops, departure time window, max duration, price range
- Alternate sorts: price, duration, departure time

### 4.4 Metasearch Redirect
- “Book” action deep-links out to a provider/partner site (no in-app booking)

### 4.5 Freshness
- “Last updated” timestamp shown
- Cached results TTL ≤ 60 seconds per identical query
- Manual refresh triggers a new provider request (subject to rate limits)

## 5) v1 Out of Scope (Not included)
- Booking, payments, fraud, refunds, changes/cancellations
- User accounts, traveler profiles, saved passengers
- Post-booking management and notifications
- Customer support workflows

## 6) Data & Privacy (v1)
- The product does **not** store sensitive PII (passport numbers, DOB, payment info, KTN, addresses).
- Any analytics (if added later) should avoid logging sensitive URLs/tokens and avoid collecting unnecessary user identifiers.

## 7) Key Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Search results displayed within **≤ 5 seconds p95**
- **Reliability:** Graceful handling of provider timeouts/partial results with clear messaging
- **Maintainability:** Provider integrations must be pluggable; scoring logic centralized and unit-tested
- **Accessibility:** Ranking explanation and badges must be accessible via screen readers; not color-only indicators

## 8) Success Criteria (Acceptance Targets)
1) Search results render in **≤ 5 seconds p95**
2) Results are ordered correctly by the disclosed ValueScore
3) Users can understand “why this is best value” within **one tap**
4) Data shown is “fresh” per provider, with cache TTL **≤ 60 seconds** and visible last-updated timestamp
5) All “Book” actions redirect externally; no booking happens inside the app
