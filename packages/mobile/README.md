# FlightValue Mobile (React Native + Expo)

Initial cross-platform UI scaffold for iOS and Android using a modern React Native stack:

- Expo SDK 52
- Expo Router (file-based navigation)
- Restyle (typed design system primitives)
- Reanimated + Gesture Handler ready for motion-driven UI

## Run locally

```bash
cd packages/mobile
npm install
npm run start
```

Use `npm run ios` or `npm run android` for native targets.
